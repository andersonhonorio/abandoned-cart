# Abandoned Carts
Abandoned carts occur when customers add products to their online shopping carts but leave the website or app before completing the purchase.

# Event-Driven Architecture
Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a powerful paradigm for building scalable and responsive systems. In the context of abandoned cart recovery, EDA allows you to respond in real-time or near-real-time to customer actions and events.

1. Event Producers > Event Brokers > Event Consumer > Event Storing

# How to applies this concept to the SFCC?

1. Event Producers: These are the components or systems responsible for generating events for example, custom events in the actions AddToCart, EditCartQuantity etc
2. Event Broker   : Hooks?
3. Event Consumer : Hooks?
4. Event Storing  : Temporary or permanent? 

5. 1. Event Identification:

- Define the events that indicate cart abandonment. Common events include "item added to cart," "checkout initiated," and "checkout abandoned."

- Implement tracking mechanisms on your e-commerce platforms to generate these events.

2. Event Routing:

- Set up an event broker (e.g., Kafka) to receive and route events.

- Ensure events are categorized and tagged to identify cart abandonment events.

3. Event Consumers:

- Develop event consumers for various channels, such as email, SMS, push notifications, and in-app messages.

- These consumers should listen for cart abandonment events and trigger appropriate responses based on customer preferences.

4. Customer Data Integration:

- Integrate your event-driven system with your customer database or Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system to access customer profiles and purchase history.

5. Personalization:

- Use customer data to personalize recovery messages. Mention the specific items left in the cart and provide incentives like discounts or free shipping.

6. Scheduling:

- Implement a scheduling system to send recovery messages at optimal times. For instance, sending an email shortly after abandonment and a follow-up SMS the next day.

7. Channel Expansion:

- Continuously monitor emerging communication channels and integrate them into your system. For example, integrate with chatbots for real-time assistance.

8. Analytics and A/B Testing:

- Track the effectiveness of your abandoned cart recovery system through analytics.

- Conduct A/B tests to optimize message content, timing, and channel selection.

9. Customer Feedback Loop:

- Allow customers to provide feedback on recovery messages, helping you refine your approach over time.
